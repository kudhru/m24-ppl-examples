Write a program in OCaml that calculates the sum of squares of all even numbers in a given list. Your program should define the following functions:

1. **`is_even`**: A function that takes an integer and returns `true` if the integer is even, otherwise `false`.
2. **`square`**: A function that takes an integer and returns its square.
3. **`sum_of_squares`**: A function that takes a list of integers, filters out the even numbers, computes their squares, and returns the sum of these squares.
4. **`main`**: The main function that calls the other functions with a predefined list of integers, computes the result, and prints it to the screen.

Your program should not take any user inputs. The final output should be the sum of squares of even numbers in the list.

### Expected Output

For the input list `[1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10]`, the output should be:

```
The sum of squares of even numbers is: 220
```

You have been provided with a template for the program. Your task is to fill in the missing parts. Do not change the `main` function.
